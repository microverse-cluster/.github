## 🧬 About the Cluster

The **Balance of the Microverse** explores how microbial communities interact with each other and their environments, and how these interactions shape health, ecology, and technology.
Our research combines **microbiology, ecology, medicine, chemistry, materials science, data science**, and **computational biology** to understand and influence microbiome-driven processes.

This GitHub organization hosts the open-source software, workflows, pipelines, and data resources developed across the Microverse research community.
