## 🚀 Getting Started

Start here to clone, run, and contribute to Microverse Cluster projects. We maintain a central example repository with quick-start guides, templates and minimal reproducible projects:

- Repository (example): [microverse-cluster/getting-started](https://github.com/microverse-cluster/getting-started)
- Quick start: clone a sample, run the provided example, and adapt the template for your code.

Quick steps (local):

```bash
# clone the getting-started repo
git clone https://github.com/microverse-cluster/getting-started.git
cd getting-started

# open the example README or run a provided script (example)
cat QUICKSTART.md
```

For instructions to create and publish the `getting-started` repository from this workspace see the `getting-started/README.md` scaffold included in the organization repo.

## 📘 Best Practices

We maintain a central repository with recommended patterns, templates, and minimal examples to help projects stay consistent and reproducible across the Microverse Cluster:

- Repository: [microverse-cluster/best-practices](https://github.com/microverse-cluster/best-practices)
- What you'll find: repository templates, documentation guidelines, CI examples, and small example workflows.

Use the `best-practices` repo as a reference when starting new projects or contributing templates and examples.


## About the Microverse Cluster

Balance of the Microverse is a Cluster of Excellence based at Friedrich Schiller University Jena that focuses on understanding how microorganisms interact and shape ecosystems. Microbes—though tiny—play essential roles in maintaining life on Earth, but their delicate balance is frequently disrupted by human activity and environmental change, leading to disease, crop loss, and ecosystem damage. The cluster brings together researchers across disciplines to study microbial communities and their dynamics. A key goal is to translate ecological principles into medical and environmental applications—enabling targeted interventions that restore or manipulate microbial balance. Alongside research, the cluster supports science communication, technology transfer, and the development of early career scientists through training, collaboration, and international exchange programs.

This GitHub page collectively hosts the open-source software, workflows, pipelines, and data resources developed across the Microverse research community.

## Contributing

At the Microverse Cluster, we believe in the power of open science and collaborative discovery. Our repositories are built by an international community of microbial bioinformaticians — and you can be part of it! Whether you’re contributing new features, improving documentation, or sharing feedback, we’re excited to work with you. If you’re new to open source, don’t worry — we’re happy to help you get started.

### To contribute:

1. **Join the organization** via invitation
2. **Transfer your repository** to make it an official Microverse project
3. Use standard practices:

   * Clear README
   * Open license (MIT/Apache recommended)
   * Versioning and release notes
